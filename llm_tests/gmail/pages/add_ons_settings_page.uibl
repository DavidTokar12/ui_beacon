    <Text value="You can install developer add-ons from Apps Script. Developer add-ons are simply add-ons which haven't been published. If you're a developer, installing your developer add-on allows you to test it prior to publishing. Some add-ons are specific to a particular organization or user and thus aren't intended for wider publication; you can install these add-ons as developer add-ons."
